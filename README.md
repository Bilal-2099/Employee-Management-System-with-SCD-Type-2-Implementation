This project showcases the development of an Employee Management System using SQL Server, which handles employee details, salaries, job titles, and departments. The system utilizes Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2 to track historical changes in job titles and salaries over time. Key features include procedures for adding and updating employee records, tracking attendance, generating salary reports, and managing historical data with efficient foreign key relationships. This project demonstrates proficiency in database design, complex queries, and data integrity management.
